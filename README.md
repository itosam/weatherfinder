# Weather Application 1

## GOALS
For this project I am using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a weather app.

I want to display the weather of a city input in the search field.

## FUNCTIONALITY

- When the button is clicked or enter key is pressed, we can search and display the weather forecast for the city entered
- display weather icon, temperature, city name, and humidity/ wind info.



## RESULTS

## Stretch Goals currently working on
- toggling between imperial and metric temperature display.
- location tracking upon page load, to display user location weather info.
