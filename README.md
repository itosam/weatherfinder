## GOALS
For this project I am using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a weather app.
I want to display the current weather of a city input in the search field.

## FUNCTIONALITY

- When the button is clicked or enter key is pressed, we can search and display the weather forecast for the city entered
- display weather icon, temperature, city name, and humidity/ wind info.



## RESULTS
- Created functional application using the <a href ="https://openweathermap.org/">OpenWeather API</a>, and can display current weather forecast with custom ui.
- Users can enter the city info using city name or zipcode, and press enter key or search icon.
- Icon and background will change based on current weather info (sunny/cloudy/rainy/etc.)

## Stretch Goals To Complete
- Add mobile responsive views.
- toggling between imperial and metric temperature display.
- location tracking upon page load, to display user location weather info.
